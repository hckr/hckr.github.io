                    I like to code and honestly don't understand
                    <span title="there are people who are interested in public transportation :o">why someone would like trains</span>

                    To each their own, I guess.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I discovered programming near the end of the primary school. I was playing with Excel and in the process of trying all the
                    interesting, and also less interesting, options. I found an editor for creating windows in which I could place different controls
                    (like buttons, text fields and so on). Even though, as far as I recall, I didn't manage to add any logic then, the sheer pleasure
                    of having my own designed window showing after pressing a "play" key on the Excel toolbar was enough to get me interested. Soon I
                    discovered it's called
                    <span title="Visual Basic for Applications">VBA</span>. Soon after I found a book about Visual Basic .NET (slightly different
                    thing) during shopping and asked my parents to buy it for me. When I got access to the internet, I stumbled upon
                    <a href="http://coderscity.net">CodersCity.net</a> (in Polish) and, after some time,
                    <a href="https://forumweb.pl">Forumweb.pl</a>, where I received much guidance.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Long history short, I started programming in Visual Basic, then I also got interested in web development. Starting with very
                    simple layuts in HTML and CSS, and poorly chosen colors, I got better over time and also learned PHP which enabled me to create
                    websites with login and interaction with a database (MySQL in my case). JavaScript followed nicely as a way to do things in
                    browser without necessarily reloading the page. On university I got a chance to finally learn how to properly manage memory in C++
                    which previously discouraged me from using it (I also got familiar with Linux which I happily use to this day), not mentioning
                    less appealing look of a console application, compared to a web page which could be easily styled with CSS (is it why we have
                    full-blown editors written in web technolgies and Electron? :D). All jokes aside, I know there are
                    <span title="Graphical User Interface">GUI</span> libraries for C++. Some even embed JavaScript engine inside (Qt's QML)! I also
                    have some experience with Python which I've used for example for convenience, web development or some kind of data science. And
                    these, of course, aren't all programming languages I've ever used.
                </p>
                <p>
                    What I mean, at some point a specific language becomes just a tool for a job and a good coder should be able to easily transition
                    between different languages and frameworks, and choose them well. I strive to be such a programmer each day :)

                    The application is based on the logical-algebraic method discussed during Decision Support Systems classes on Wroclaw University
                    of Science and Technology. The program infers, based on previously defined variables and logical facts, what the effects of the
                    decisions given by the user will be (analysis task) or what decisions should be made to achieve the desired effects (decision
                    support task). The loaded database relates to yacht control. I was responsible for the implementation, a friend of mine developed
                    the logical rules.

                    correctness and <code>?</code> will be replaced with lists with meaningful variable names. After the selection is made, results
                    are shown below in a form of a table and logical expressions.

                    screenshot (with all replies expanded). Screenshot can be also anonymized (profile pictures blurred, names replaced with
                    identifiers like "OP", "Profile 1", "Profile 2" and so on). Large posts are split into multiple images each at most 8192 px tall
                    (this can be changed up to 16000 px).

                <p>
                    The task was to make a game using only the provided assets with a couple of exceptions. I'm not much interested in games, hence I
                    don't know what genre it is that I created. But it's definetety somewhat arcade and somewhat a puzzle. The goal of each level is
                    to reach a field with the spaceship. Fields disappear one second after standing on them which means you must move fast.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The game has multiple levels which means I had to design them somehow. I created a
                    <a class="highlighted" href="https://github.com/hckr/space-logic-adventure/tree/master/dist/assets/levels"
                        >text format for level files</a
                    >. Assets were supplied as separate files, so I created
                    <a class="highlighted" href="https://github.com/hckr/space-logic-adventure/blob/master/tools/tileset_gen.py"
                        >a very simple texture packer</a
                    >. At some places the code could've been written better and some functionality not required by current levels isn't finished (I
                    was coding it <span style="letter-spacing: 0.3em;">fast</span>). Maybe I'll revisit and improve the game in the future.

                    Library makes it easy to schedule tasks (which can be anything assignable to
                    <code>std::function</code>) to be executed in one of threads in a pool and then possibly receive a result if there is any (as a
                    thread pool should do per definition). I think it's an interesting peace of code to learn about the concurrency features added in
                    C++11. My implementation makes use of <code>std::unique_lock</code>, <code>std::mutex</code> and
                    <code>std::condition_variable</code> for synchronization, and <code>std::packaged_task</code> which wraps a callable (and is
                    ultimately called by one of the threads) and makes available a <code>std::future</code> which is returned to the user and provides
                    access to the task result when it's ready.
